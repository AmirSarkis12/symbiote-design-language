            <h1>Components</h1>

            <p>Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.</p>

            <p>Individual components can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. For example, the Card component can be used to display a promotion, or provide a call to action for the user to click through. The goal in mind is that components are kept consistant in terms of style and interactivity throughout your website.</p>

            <p>Each component has a set of rules that determine how and when it should be used.</p>
